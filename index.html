                    <p>Before buying a geofencing phone app, there are quite a few variables you need to consider, such as the app’s tracking capabilities, compatibility with different devices, and other tracking and monitoring features you’ll have access to with your subscription.</p>
                    <p>Here are in-depth reviews of the best geofencing apps, so you can easily compare them and choose the one that’s best for you.</p>
                    <h3 id="buddypunch">1. Buddy Punch — Significantly enhances workforce management through its robust geofencing capabilities</h3>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Buddy Punch significantly enhances workforce management through its robust geofencing capabilities. Geofencing allows employers to set virtual boundaries around specific work locations using GPS technology. With Buddy Punch, this means employees can only clock in or out when they are physically within these designated areas. This feature ensures that time entries are accurate and that employees are where they are supposed to be during their working hours, reducing time theft and increasing overall accountability.</p>
                    <p>The software's geofencing is highly customizable and user-friendly. Employers can easily create multiple geofenced zones by entering addresses or pinpointing locations on a map within the platform. This is particularly beneficial for businesses with multiple job sites or mobile workforces. Buddy Punch then uses real-time GPS data from employees' devices to verify their location upon clocking in or out, seamlessly integrating this information into the time tracking system.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, Buddy Punch's geofencing feature works hand-in-hand with its scheduling and reporting tools. Managers receive instant notifications if an employee attempts to punch in or out outside of the approved areas, allowing for prompt corrective action. Detailed reports can be generated to analyze attendance patterns and ensure compliance with labor regulations. This comprehensive approach streamlines operations and contributes to more accurate payroll processing.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>uMobix takes a unique approach to mobile phone location tracking. Rather than simply providing you with a list of visited locations, uMobix shows you the exact paths the device takes from one location to another, allowing you to see your child’s travel patterns. This is extremely useful for determining whether they’re taking the usual routes or using detours and going out of their way to visit certain places and areas.</p>
                    <p>That said, uMobix doesn’t have geofencing capabilities. While you can review the device’s full location history, you won’t be able to track your child in real-time or rely on the app to notify you when they enter or leave a certain area. In other words, you’d have to monitor their phone constantly, and even then, you’ll only be able to see their location once they arrive at their destination. </p>
                    <p>uMobix has a plethora of other useful monitoring features, including the ability to see all phone calls, SMS messages, and social media chats on the target device. Still, if you’re primarily interested in geofencing, we suggest choosing a different phone tracking app from our list.</p>

                    <p>Cocospy is a decent all-around phone monitoring app with powerful, precise GPS location tracking features. You can use Cocospy to monitor the device’s exact location in real time, review the location history (including date stamps and precise coordinates), and set up geofencing alerts.</p>
                    <p>In addition to geofencing, Cocospy lets you monitor your child’s activity on all popular social media platforms and instant messaging apps, as well as see exactly what they’re searching for online. You’ll also be able to access all call logs, shared media, photos, and videos on the device. </p>
                    <p>Another powerful feature of Cocospy is the ability to detect SIM card changes. If your child loses a phone or has the device stolen, Cocospy will notify you if a third party replaces the phone’s SIM card. It will also help you triangulate the device’s location, so you can continue tracking the phone and recover the device. </p>

                    <p>Hoverwatch is an all-around solid phone monitoring app, but it doesn’t bring anything new to the table regarding location tracking. It lets you see the location history and the travel pattern on the device, but it doesn’t support geofencing or real-time location monitoring.</p>
                    <p>This is a major drawback, especially considering that Hoverwatch is slightly more expensive than the leading alternatives like mSpy and Eyezy. </p>
                    <p>While not the best option for geofencing, Hoverwatch truly shines when it comes to phone call recording, allowing you to listen to every phone call made to and from the device. Another reason to opt for Hoverwatch is the fact that it takes frequent screenshots, giving you invaluable insights into your child’s phone activity.</p>

                    <p>Qustodio is the best choice if you want to track the location of multiple family members. With a single subscription, you can monitor and track up to ten devices, see their location in real time, and view all addresses they visited in the past seven days.</p>
                    <p>Every monitored device is depicted by a different animal icon on the map, making it easy to tell where different people are on the map at a glance. The app also includes geofencing, allowing you to set up restricted zones on the map, which are shared between all the different devices.</p>
                    <p>Another thing we love about Qustodio is the fact that it provides you with detailed daily, weekly, and monthly reports of your children’s online activity. This means you’ll know exactly what they’re searching for online and what content they interact with, while not having to monitor their phones 24/7.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="assets/images/the_one_spy.png" class="img-fluid w-100" alt="Image">
                    </figure>
                    <p>TheOneSpy has excellent location tracking capabilities, allowing you to monitor the device’s exact location in real time, using live GPS tracking. You can also use it to set up safe and restricted zones on the map and get real-time alerts whenever the device crosses one of the virtual boundaries you created on the map.</p>
                    <p>The one gripe we have with TheOneSpy comes from the fact that fences and locations are really difficult to see. When you select a particular location, the app opens the map in a small overlay window rather than opening the map in full-screen or on a different tab. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re trying to discern your child’s location on a smaller screen (e.g., your phone). </p>
                    <p>If TheOneSpy developers rework the app’s UI, it will be a serious contender for the best geofencing app, but until then, we strongly suggest one of the more optimized alternatives like mSpy and eyeZy.</p>

                    <h2>What is Geofencing?</h2>
                    <p>Geofencing refers to the feature of phone tracking software, which enables you to create artificial, virtual boundaries on the map. When a monitored device enters or leaves an area you set up on the map, you will instantly get a notification. This enables you to keep tabs on your children without having to monitor their device’s location 24/7.</p>
                    <h2>How Does a Geofencing App Work?</h2>
                    <p>Geofencing software leverages the global positioning system (GPS) to monitor the device’s location in real time. By triangulating the coordinates of the device, a geofencing app will detect whenever the phone enters or leaves a particular area on the map and will notify you so you can take appropriate action (e.g., call your child and inquire about where they’re going).</p>
                    <h2>Best Free Geofencing Tools </h2>
                    <p>If you’re looking for free geofencing apps, you’ll be disappointed to learn that there are virtually no phone tracking applications with advanced geofencing capabilities that are completely free. The closest thing you’ll get to a free geofencing app is a free trial, but even then, most phone trackers limit the use of GPS location features. </p>
                    <p>If you want a reliable phone tracking app with accurate GPS tracking, geofencing, and real-time alerts, your best bet is to opt for a premium plan from one of the best geofencing apps on our list, like mSpy, eyeZy, or Cocospy. </p>
                    <h2>How to Use a Geofencing App</h2>
                    <p>Here’s a step-by-step guide for using mSpy — the best geofencing app in 2024 — to set up geofencing and start tracking your children’s location in real time today. </p>
                    <h3>Step 1: Get the mSpy Geofencing App</h3>
                    <p>Navigate to mSpy’s official website and click the “Try Now” button. </p>
                    <h3>Step 2: Select the Payment Plan that Suits You Best</h3>
                    <p>Before you can finish creating your account, you have to choose a payment plan. You’ll have the option between one month, three months, or twelve months. If you opt for the yearly plan, you’ll save $60 on your subscription!</p>
                    <h3>Step 3: Download mSpy on the Target Device</h3>
                    <p>Open the email you provided during account creation and find the message from the mSpy team. </p>
                    <p>Click the link provided in the email to download the mSpy app on the target device. Follow the simple prompts on the screen and provide mSpy with all the necessary permissions.</p>
                    <p>Use the login credentials provided in the email to log into the mSpy dashboard.</p>
                    <h3>Step 4: Set up Geofencing</h3>
                    <p>From the mSpy dashboard, navigate to the Geofencing tab on the left-hand side. Choose between Allowed and Restricted zones, click the + button, and select the area on the map.</p>
                    <p>That’s all there is to it — geofencing and GPS location tracking is that simple with mSpy!</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that you can add multiple allowed and restricted zones. You’ll receive a notification the moment the monitored device enters or leaves any of these zones.</p>
                    <h2>Best Geofencing Apps FAQs</h2>
                    <h3>Can I do Geofencing Myself?</h3>
                    <p>If you purchase a premium subscription to the best geofencing apps like mSpy or eyeZy, you can set up geofencing yourself by creating safe and restricted areas on the map.</p>
                    <h3>Does Geofencing Really Work?</h3>
                    <p>Geofencing relies on GPS to triangulate the monitored device’s exact location. It works the same way as GPS works in your car or on your phone when you’re trying to find a new restaurant using Google Maps. In short, it absolutely works.</p>
                    <h3>What is the best Geofencing App?</h3>
                    <p>After testing dozens of geofencing apps, our number one pick for the best geofencing app is mSpy. It has laser-targeted location tracking, allows you to set up unlimited safe and restricted zones, and it instantly notifies you when the device enters or leaves any of the zones you set up on the map.</p>
                    <h3>Can You Track Someone’s Location Without Touching Their Phone?</h3>
                    <p>It’s possible to track someone’s phone without physical access to their device, but only if they’re using an iPhone that’s connected to iCloud. Even then, you’d need their iCloud login credentials in order to use the phone tracking app to access their device information.</p>
                    <p>One thing to keep in mind is that you can only legally monitor your children’s devices, provided that they are minors and are using a phone that’s registered in your name. If you want to monitor the device of your partner, spouse, employees, or anyone else, you will first have to obtain their informed consent.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion — What is the Best Geofencing App in 2024?</h2>
                    <p>When it comes to choosing the best geofencing iPhone app or finding the best geofencing Android apps, the most important thing to consider is how accurate the app is and whether or not it provides real-time location updates. </p>
                    <p>Most of the apps we recommend in this article allow you to set up safe and restricted zones and view the complete location history. However, geofencing and location tracking is just a single feature the leading phone tracking apps provide. </p>
                    <p>Since you’ll be paying upwards of $10/month regardless of what geofencing app you opt for, we strongly recommend comparing their other functionalities as well, such as phone call and SMS monitoring, app blocking, and the ability to view the device’s internet history.</p>
                    <p>Despite the tough competition, mSpy has earned our number-one spot as the best geofencing app for 2024. It offers dedicated geofencing apps for iOS and Android that are simple and easy to use, and it provides laser-targeted location tracking, full device location history, smart geofencing, and real-time notifications.</p>
                    <p>Take advantage of mSpy’s yearly plan to save $60 and start tracking your children’s phone locations today with the most powerful geofencing app in 2024.</p>
